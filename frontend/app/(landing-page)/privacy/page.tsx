            <p>
              When you sign up for Crewaa, we collect information you provide directly — such as your name,
              email address, role (brand or creator), and profile details. If you sign in with Google, we
              receive your name and email from Google's OAuth service. We do not access your Google account
              beyond what is required for authentication.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              We also collect information automatically as you use the platform, including usage data,
              device information, and log data such as your IP address and pages visited. This helps us
              improve the product and debug issues.

            <p>
              We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for their marketing
              purposes. We may share data with trusted service providers (such as cloud hosting and
              analytics tools) solely to operate the platform. These providers are bound by confidentiality
              agreements and are not permitted to use your data for any other purpose.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Creator profile data (such as social media usernames and public metrics) may be visible to
              brands using the platform for discovery purposes — this is core to Crewaa's functionality.

              We retain your data for as long as your account is active. You may delete your account at

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">5. Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              Crewaa uses minimal cookies necessary for authentication and session management. We do not
              use tracking cookies or third-party advertising cookies.

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">6. Security</h2>
            <p>
              We take security seriously. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt and never stored in plain text.
              All data is transmitted over HTTPS. While we implement industry-standard safeguards, no
              system is completely immune to breaches and we encourage you to use a strong, unique password.
