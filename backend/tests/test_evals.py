"""
Tests for the prompt eval suite.

An eval suite that passes everything is worse than no eval suite: it produces a
green tick that people trust. So the bulk of this file is not "does the suite
pass on good output" — it is "does the suite *fail* on output we know is bad".

Every degradation below is a real thing a model or a prompt edit could do, and
each one is asserted to be caught.
