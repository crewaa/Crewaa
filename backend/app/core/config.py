    #: bcrypt cost factor. Each step doubles the work: 12 is ~180ms on a laptop
    #: and noticeably more on a small shared instance. Lower it to 11 or 10 if

    #: exceed the slowest legitimate scrape (Apify runs take well under a minute).

    # on different registrable domains, so the refresh cookie is a *cross-site*
    # cookie. Browsers only send those with `SameSite=None`, and only accept
    # `SameSite=None` when `Secure` is also set — hence both, together.
    #
    # Locally everything is on localhost, which is same-site, and `Secure`
    # would stop the cookie being set over plain http. So the two flags move
    # together with the environment rather than being hardcoded either way.
